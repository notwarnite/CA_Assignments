This Repository contains Computer Architecture Lab (CS311) Assignment-0 Solutions and End-Report.

Main Class (Driver Code) and supporting Classes are contained in Folder : 'ca_assignment_0', to run an experiment clone this repository, change current directory to 'ca_assignment_0' and run command 'java Main.java'. The outputs will be generated to a File : 'output.csv'. 3D Plot of the generated output can be obtained by using the File : 'ouputgraph.py', to do so, change your directory to 'Assignment0' by running command 'cd ..' and then run 'python ouputgraph.py' or 'python3 outputgraph.py'. A 3D Plot of Average Time Taken of 1000 iterations for specific pairs of Sensor P-value and Border Width will be generated.
